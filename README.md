# quiz-app
Quiz app generator

To get started with the app, follow these steps:

Clone the repository to your local machine: git clone https://github.com/arminCicic/quiz-app.git

Install dependencies using npm install

Start the Angular app locally - npm start

Also, because app uses fake JSON server, start the fake JSON server locally -    json-server --watch db.json --routes routes.json

Once the app and fake JSON server are running, you can access the app at http://localhost:4200
JSON server should run on http://localhost:3000
